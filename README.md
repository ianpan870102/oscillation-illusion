# oscillation-illusion
A simple fun oscillation (sine function) illusion using the JS library: p5.js

*Inspired by "Bees and Bombs" and "TheCodingTrain".*

The programme consists of two simple files: an `index.html` and a `sketch.js`
Perhaps the easiest way to view the illusion is to simply open the index.html file in your preferred browser.
